## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

Pair programming is a common industry practice where two developers work on the same project together. Typically, one person is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". Throughout the lab you must switch roles.

Here are two explanations of pair-programming, it's benefits and how to do it:

2. [Agile Best Practices: Pair Programming](https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-software-programming-best-practices/pair-programming/)

## Domains
Pick from one of the following project ideas. If you and your partner would like to come up with your own domain, run it by an instructor first for sign-off.

### HackerNews style link aggregation site
Users can post news links to the site where they get aggregated on the home page. Each link should have a url, title, brief description and the date it was posted. The homepage of the site should list all the most recently posted links. As a bonus, add the ability to comment on links.
